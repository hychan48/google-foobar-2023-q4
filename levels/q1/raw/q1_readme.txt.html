    The cake is not a lie!<br>======================<br>

    Commander Lambda has had an incredibly successful week: the first test of the LAMBCHOP doomsday device was completed AND Lambda set a new personal high score in Tetris. To celebrate, the Commander ordered cake for everyone -- even the lowliest of minions! But competition among minions is fierce, and if you don&#39;t cut exactly equal slices of cake for everyone you&#39;ll get in big trouble. <br><br>The cake is round, and decorated with M&amp;Ms in a circle around the edge. But while the rest of the cake is uniform, the M&amp;Ms are not: there are multiple colors, and every minion must get exactly the same sequence of M&amp;Ms. Commander Lambda hates waste and will not tolerate any leftovers, so you also want to make sure you can serve the entire cake.<br><br>To help you best cut the cake, you have turned the sequence of colors of the M&amp;Ms on the cake into a string: each possible letter (between a and z) corresponds to a unique color, and the sequence of M&amp;Ms is given clockwise (the decorations form a circle around the outer edge of the cake).<br><br>Write a function called solution(s) that, given a non-empty string less than 200 characters in length describing the sequence of M&amp;Ms, returns the maximum number of equal parts that can be cut from the cake without leaving any leftovers.<br>

    <br>Test cases<br>==========<br>
    Your code should pass the following test cases.<br>Note that it may also be run against hidden test cases not shown here.<br><br>

    -- Python cases --<br>
    Input:<br>solution.solution(&quot;abccbaabccba&quot;)<br>Output:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br><br>

    Input:<br>solution.solution(&quot;abcabcabcabc&quot;)<br>Output:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br><br>
    -- Java cases --<br>
    Input:<br>Solution.solution(&quot;abccbaabccba&quot;)<br>Output:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br><br>

    Input:<br>Solution.solution(&quot;abcabcabcabc&quot;)<br>Output:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br><br>
