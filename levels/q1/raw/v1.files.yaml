    Java<br>====<br>
    Your code will be compiled using standard Java 8. All tests will be run by calling the solution() method inside the Solution class<br>
    <br>
    Execution time is limited.<br>
    <br>
    Wildcard imports and some specific classes are restricted (e.g. java.lang.ClassLoader). You will receive an error when you verify your solution if you have used a restricted class.<br>
    <br>
    Third-party libraries, input/output operations, spawning threads or processes and changes to the execution environment are not allowed.<br>
    <br>
    Your solution must be under 32000 characters in length including new lines and other non-printing characters.<br>
    <br>Python<br>======<br>
    Your code will run inside a Python 2.7.13 sandbox. All tests will be run by calling the solution() function.<br>
    <br>
    Standard libraries are supported except for bz2, crypt, fcntl, mmap, pwd, pyexpat, select, signal, termios, thread, time, unicodedata, zipimport, zlib.<br>

    The cake is not a lie!<br>======================<br>

    Commander Lambda has had an incredibly successful week: the first test of the LAMBCHOP doomsday device was completed AND Lambda set a new personal high score in Tetris. To celebrate, the Commander ordered cake for everyone -- even the lowliest of minions! But competition among minions is fierce, and if you don&#39;t cut exactly equal slices of cake for everyone you&#39;ll get in big trouble. <br><br>The cake is round, and decorated with M&amp;Ms in a circle around the edge. But while the rest of the cake is uniform, the M&amp;Ms are not: there are multiple colors, and every minion must get exactly the same sequence of M&amp;Ms. Commander Lambda hates waste and will not tolerate any leftovers, so you also want to make sure you can serve the entire cake.<br><br>To help you best cut the cake, you have turned the sequence of colors of the M&amp;Ms on the cake into a string: each possible letter (between a and z) corresponds to a unique color, and the sequence of M&amp;Ms is given clockwise (the decorations form a circle around the outer edge of the cake).<br><br>Write a function called solution(s) that, given a non-empty string less than 200 characters in length describing the sequence of M&amp;Ms, returns the maximum number of equal parts that can be cut from the cake without leaving any leftovers.<br>

    To provide a Python solution, edit <span class="term-yellow">solution.py</span><br>
    To provide a Java solution, edit <span class="term-yellow">Solution.java</span><br>

    <br>Test cases<br>==========<br>
    Your code should pass the following test cases.<br>Note that it may also be run against hidden test cases not shown here.<br><br>

    -- Python cases --<br>
    Input:<br>solution.solution(&quot;abccbaabccba&quot;)<br>Output:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br><br>

    Input:<br>solution.solution(&quot;abcabcabcabc&quot;)<br>Output:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br><br>
    -- Java cases --<br>
    Input:<br>Solution.solution(&quot;abccbaabccba&quot;)<br>Output:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br><br>

    Input:<br>Solution.solution(&quot;abcabcabcabc&quot;)<br>Output:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br><br>


    Use <span class="term-yellow">verify [file]</span> to test your solution and see how it does.
    When you are finished editing your code, use <span class="term-yellow">submit [file]</span> to submit your answer.
    If your solution passes the test cases, it will be removed from your home folder.
